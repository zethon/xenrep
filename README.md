# Xen Rep

This plugin is based off the original "rep" functionality that existed for years on my message board [AMB](https://www.anothermessageboard.com). 

AMB originally ran vBulletin 3.x which had a feature that allowed users to rate posts and leave a comment with the rating. Originally these comments were only viewable to the person who made the post, however some time around 2006 I installed an addon that displayed the comments directly in the post. This functionality became very popular on AMB, and was known as "rep". 

In early 2019 I switched to Xenforo and the rep functionality was lost. This addon recaptures the essence of the AMB rep functionality.

# Links that Helped

This is my first Xenforo addon. Previously I had written multiple addons for vBulletin 3.x, but this is the first addon I've written for any message board years.

I thought it would be helpful to keep track of some of the links I found useful when searching for foundmental information about writing Xenforo addons. These are some of those links:
